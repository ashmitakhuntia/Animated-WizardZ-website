# 🌟 Animated-WizardZ-Website (Mini Project)

This is a *mini animated website project*, created just for learning and practice purposes.  
It’s not a real or live website — rather a *clone-style project* where I focused mainly on adding *smooth animations* and *visual effects*.

## 🎨 About the Project

The main goal of this project was to explore *web animation design* using image and layer-based animation created in *GSAP*.  
I learned how to bring designs to life with motion and transitions, making the website more interactive and visually appealing.
